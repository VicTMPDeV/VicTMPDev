# Â¡Â¡Â¡ Hello :earth_africa: !!! ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;=> &nbsp;I am . . .

<p style="text-align: center;">My name is VÃ­ctor Morales PÃ©rez. I'm a spanish Junior Developer that started to learn about software development about four years ago. <em>(before of that I use to work as a Building Engeneer and CG Designer)</em>. Nowadays I'm interested in acquiring new knowledge about Front-End Development, because I like so much Graphic Design <em>(as you can see in my self-made profile logos)</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">In this personal repository I'm gonna share all my latest code and some old personal projects. Everyone on GitHub can use them the way they want to. If anyone also wants to improve something, it would be nice for me too!! <em>(I'm aware of my coding shortcomings as a junior developer)</em>. </p>
