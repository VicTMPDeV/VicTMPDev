<p style="text-align: center;">I'm a Junior Developer that started to learn about software development about four years ago. ( before of that I use to work as a Building Engeneer and CG Designer ). Nowadays I'm interested in acquiring new knowledge about Front-End Development, because I like so much Graphic Design (as you can see in my self-made profile logos)</p>
